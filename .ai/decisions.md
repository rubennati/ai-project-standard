# Decisions

## 2026-05-09 - Repository name

Decision: The repository name is `AI Project Standard`.

## 2026-05-09 - Language policy

Decision: Project documentation and collaboration content are English only.

## 2026-05-09 - License

Decision: The project uses the MIT License.

## 2026-05-09 - AI workspace location

Decision: AI operational context is stored under `.ai/`.

## 2026-05-09 - Default Git workflow

Decision: Use GitHub Flow / trunk-based workflow with short-lived branches.

## 2026-05-09 - No default GitFlow

Decision: GitFlow is not the default workflow for this repository.

## 2026-05-09 - Separate AI workspace from project docs

Decision: Keep AI operational state in `.ai/` and keep human-facing documentation in `docs/` and root files.

Rationale: Separation improves maintainability, review clarity, and continuity across tools.

## 2026-05-10 - Human approval model

Decision: "Human approval" is defined as a human merging the pull request. Agents may commit and push to non-`main` branches; agents must not merge to `main`, force-push, or modify branch protection. The full rule lives in the "Approval" section of `AGENTS.md`; `CLAUDE.md` and `.github/copilot-instructions.md` point at it.

Rationale: The previous "do not commit, push, or merge without explicit human approval" rule was repeated in four files but never operationalised, leaving agents unable to tell what was actually permitted. Defining it once in `AGENTS.md` removes ambiguity and prevents drift across the AI-instruction surface.

## 2026-06-07 - Site localization foundation

Decision: The Astro site uses English as the canonical locale with parallel German routes under `/de/`. Localization is implemented with Astro i18n configuration, centralized UI strings, explicit localized route files for the current public pages, and term-level fallback from German to English where translations are missing.

Rationale: This keeps the first multilingual foundation small, reviewable, and SEO-safe while avoiding a one-off glossary-only translation layer. It also leaves room to scale into broader site localization later without changing the public English route structure.

## 2026-08-03 - Site content licence

Decision: Texts written for the website are licensed CC BY 4.0. The repository,
including everything under `docs/`, stays MIT. CC BY-NC was rejected: the site
renders `docs/*.md` directly, and those files are already MIT, which
irrevocably permits commercial use — an NC clause would have contradicted the
repository on the same text. NC is also undefined at the edges, and a standard
depends on being adopted, companies included.

## 2026-08-03 - Site brand name

Decision: The website is branded "AI Standard" everywhere, metadata included.
The repository keeps the name `ai-project-standard`. A visible brand that
disagrees with `og:site_name` would hand search engines the other name.
