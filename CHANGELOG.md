# Changelog

All notable changes to this project should be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `docs/standard.md` — canonical document describing the standard itself (what it is, mandatory vs optional, two-baseline philosophy, layered architecture).
- `docs/profiles.md` — three adoption profiles (OSS-only, AI-only, Combined) with explicit, machine-readable file lists. No wildcards; consumed by the future Profile-Completeness CI check.
- `docs/adoption.md` — adoption steps per profile and an Updating-from-previous-version workflow for downstream adopters.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` — new "Versioning" section defining MAJOR/MINOR/PATCH for the standard.
- `README.md` — positioning sentence and Profiles section linking to the new docs.
- `docs/index.md` — restructured into grouped sections (the standard, OSS baseline, Human-AI Collaboration baseline) and links the new AI Tools doc.
- `docs/ai-tools.md` — multi-AI conventions document covering Claude Code, Codex/Codex CLI, GitHub Copilot, Cursor, and ChatGPT (out-of-scope) with a clear single-source-of-truth model and instructions for adding new tools.
- `.cursor/rules/00-project.mdc` — Cursor rule (modern MDC format, `alwaysApply: true`) pointing to `AGENTS.md`.
- `AGENTS.md` — new "Tool-specific pointer files" section listing the pointer files and an anti-duplication rule (pointers stay short and defer to `AGENTS.md`).
- `CLAUDE.md`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` — restated as thin pointer files; rule duplication removed.
- `site/` — minimal Astro skeleton for the GitHub Pages knowledge layer (Astro 5, Tailwind v4). Includes a base layout and five static pages (Home, Use cases, Profiles, About, Blog stub). No content collection, no RSS, no JSON-LD — those land in later PRs by design.
- `site/public/robots.txt` and Astro sitemap integration configured.
- `.gitignore` — exclude `site/node_modules/`, `site/dist/`, `site/.astro/`.
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — three new jobs gating PRs to `main`: `markdown-lint`, `link-check`, and `profile-completeness`. A weekly cron (Mondays 06:00 UTC) runs the link check in strict mode.
- `.github/scripts/check-profiles.sh` — POSIX-portable bash script that parses the fenced `text` blocks in `docs/profiles.md` and verifies every listed path exists. No wildcards, no glob expansion — deterministic by design.
- `.markdownlint-cli2.jsonc` — relaxed markdownlint config tuned for a documentation-and-standards repository.
- `.lycheeignore` — exclusions for localhost previews and `mailto:` links.

### Changed

- Minor markdown formatting fixes in `README.md`, `SECURITY.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `docs/getting-started.md`, and the issue templates to satisfy the new lint rules. No content changes.
- `README.md` — new "Website" section documenting the Pages URL and the one-time maintainer setup step.

### Added — PR 6 (Pages deploy + custom domain)

- `.github/workflows/pages.yml` — builds `site/` with Node 20 LTS and Astro 5, uploads the artifact, and deploys via `actions/deploy-pages@v4`. Triggered by pushes to `main` that touch `site/`, `docs/`, or the workflow itself, plus `workflow_dispatch`. Concurrency group `pages` with `cancel-in-progress: false`.
- `site/public/CNAME` — pins the custom domain `ai-standard.rubennati.at` so each Actions-based deploy preserves it (GitHub Pages settings alone don't survive workflow deploys).
- `site/astro.config.mjs` — `site` updated to the custom domain; `base` removed (custom domain serves from root).
- `site/public/robots.txt` — sitemap URL updated to the custom domain.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-05-12

First public release of the repository standard. Intended as a starting point for pilot usage; expect iteration based on real-world feedback.

### Added

- `.ai/` workspace with operational state, routing, tasks, decisions, risks, errors, quality gates, secure-development notes, and domain guides.
- Root governance documents: `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, `SECURITY.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, MIT `LICENSE`.
- Documentation set in `docs/`: open-source project standard, getting started, git workflow, branch protection, `.ai/` workspace layer, practical AI collaboration.
- Baseline `.gitignore` (including Claude Code local settings) and GitHub configuration.
- Branch protection on `main` via a Repository Ruleset (PR required, conversation resolution required, force pushes and branch deletion blocked).
